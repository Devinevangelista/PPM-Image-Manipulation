PPM Image Manipulation Project

When the makefile is ran, it will prompt the user to:

1. reduce the size of the image by halving the amount of total pixels within the array.

2. superimpose a greenscreen image onto another image by changing all the green pixels to the other image.

3. reduce the superimposed image by running the superimposed image output in the reduce size function.

4. quit the program
