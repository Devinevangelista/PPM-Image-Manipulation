This code manipulates PPM images using C

When ran, the makefile prompts the user to either

reduce the size of the image by halving the amount of total pixels within the array
superimpose a greenscreen image onto another image by changing all the green pixels to the other image.
reduce the superimposed image by running the superimposed image output in the reduce size function.
