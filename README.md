PPM Image Manipulation Project

When the makefile is ran, it will prompt the user to:

reduce the size of the image by halving the amount of total pixels within the array.

superimpose a greenscreen image onto another image by changing all the green pixels to the other image.

reduce the superimposed image by running the superimposed image output in the reduce size function.
